# Solar PV System Data Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing data from the University of Eswatiniâ€™s 82.56 kW solar PV system located at Kwaluseni campus. The project aims to optimize system performance, support maintenance planning, and enhance sustainability goals by processing and modeling solar energy data.

## Project Overview
The solar PV system, consisting of 258 monocrystalline panels (320 W each), SMA Tripower and Sunny Island inverters, and a 48V VRLA battery bank, faces challenges such as a faulty cluster controller, non-functional panel arrays, and missing predictive tools. This repository includes codes to:
- Process time-series data (energy output, irradiance, temperature) collected via the SMA Data Manager M.
- Perform data cleaning, quality control, and feature engineering.
- Implement machine learning models (LSTM and Prophet) for energy prediction and forecasting.
- Visualize trends and performance metrics to guide interventions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `prophet`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-pv-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solar-pv-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required packages (see `requirements.txt`).

### Usage
- Place your solar PV data (CSV format) in the `data/` folder.
- Run the main analysis script:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
- Explore individual scripts (e.g., `data_cleaning.py`, `ml_prediction.py`) for specific tasks.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets (e.g., energy output, irradiance).
- `src/`: Python scripts for data analysis.
  - `data_cleaning.py`: Handles missing data and normalization.
  - `ml_prediction.py`: Implements LSTM and Prophet models.
  - `visualization.py`: Generates plots for performance trends.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.
